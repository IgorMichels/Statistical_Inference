    abstract = {A broadly applicable algorithm for computing maximum likelihood estimates from incomplete data is presented at various levels of generality. Theory showing the monotone behaviour of the likelihood and convergence of the algorithm is derived. Many examples are sketched, including missing value situations, applications to grouped, censored or truncated data, finite mixture models, variance component estimation, hyperparameter estimation, iteratively reweighted least squares and factor analysis.},

    abstract = {We propose a method for estimating parameters in binomial regression models when the response variable is missing and the missing data mechanism is nonignorable. We assume throughout that the covariates are fully observed. Using a logit model for the missing data mechanism, we show how parameter estimation can be accomplished using the EM algorithm by the method of weights proposed in Ibrahim (1990, Journal of the American Statistical Association 85, 765-769). An example from the Six Cities Study (Ware et al., 1984, American Review of Respiratory Diseases 129, 366-374) is presented to illustrate the method.},

    abstract="Several large-scale educational surveys use item response theory (IRT) models to summarize complex cognitive responses and relate them to educational and demographic variables. The IRT models are often multidimensional with prespecified traits, and maximum likelihood estimates (MLEs) are found using an EM algorithm, which is typically very slow to converge. We show that the slow convergence is due primarily to missing information about the correlations between latent traits relative to the information that would be present if these traits were observed (``complete data''). We show how to accelerate convergence using parameter extended EM (PX-EM), a recent modification of the EM algorithm. The PX-EM modification is simple to implement for the IRT survey model and reduces the number of required iterations by approximately one-half without adding any appreciable computation to each EM-iteration.",
